# To Do List

This is the infamous list tha everyone must do. 

I started a new tutorial, The Complete iOS 10 Developer Course by Rob Percival on Udemy.com. 

There is nothing particularly spectacular about this commit, except I intentionally started it with the intent to do what most tutorials have overlooked, using the MVC pattern. 

This may sound trivial, but its not so easy to unlearn bad programming habits. Since we don't know any better, we get used to tossing in an array on any ol' view controller...

I will revisit this from time to time, to make some improvements, and as a reminder of the right way to begin.
